                <d class="name">Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (Mahatma Gandhi)</d> was born on October 2, 1869, into a
                Hindu Modh
                family in
                Porbanadar, Gujarat, India. His father, named Karamchand Gandhi, was the Chief Minister (diwan) of the
                city
                of Porbanadar. His mother, named Putlibai, was the fourth wife; the previous three wives died in
                childbirth.
                Gandhi was born into the vaishya (business caste). He was 13 years old when married Kasturbai (Ba)
                Makhanji,
                through his parents arrangement. They had four sons. Gandhi learned tolerance and non-injury to living
                beings from an early age. He was abstinent from meat, alcohol, and promiscuity.<br>
                <br>
                Gandhi studied law at the University of Bombay for one year, then at the University College London, from
                which he graduated in 1891, and was admitted to the bar of England. His reading of "Civil Disobedience"
                by David Thoreau inspired his devotion to the principle of non-violence. He returned to Bombay and
                practiced law there for a year, then went to South Africa to work for an Indian firm in Natal. There
                Gandhi experienced racism: he was thrown off a train while holding a valid first class ticket and pushed
                to third class. Later he was beaten by a stagecoach driver for refusing to travel on the foot-board to
                make room for a European passenger. He was barred from many hotels because of his race. In 1894, Gandhi
                founded the Natal Indian Congress. They focused on the Indian cause and British discrimination in South
                Africa. In 1897, Gandhi brought his wife and children to South Africa. He was attacked by a mob of
                racists, who tried to lynch him. He refused to press charges on any member of the mob. Gandhi became the
                first non-white lawyer to be admitted to the bar in South Africa.
                <br><br>
                India won independence in 1947, followed by the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947, and partition of India.
                Gandhi said, "Before partitioning India, my body will have to be cut into two pieces." About one million
                people died in the bloody riots until partition was reluctantly asserted by Gandhi as the only way to
                stop the Civil War. He urged the Congress Party to accept partition, and launched his last
                "fast-into-death" campaign in Delhi, calling for a stop to all violence. Gandhi also called to give
                Pakistan the 550,000,000 rupees in honor of the partition agreement. He tried to prevent instability and
                anger against India.

                Gandhi was shot three times in the chest and died while on his way to a prayer meeting, on January 30,
                1948. His assassins were convicted and executed a year later. The ashes of Mahatma Gandhi were split in
                portions and sent to all states of India to be scattered in rivers. Part of Gandhi's ashes rest in Raj
                Ghat, near Delhi, India. Part of Mahatma Gandhi's ashes are at the Lake Shrine in Los Angeles.
